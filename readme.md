## Introduction
This project introduces the "grayscale diffusion framework" for modeling and understanding the propagation of dark assets in the Bitcoin network. By utilizing address clustering, haircut tainting, and community partitioning, this framework offers a unique analysis perspective on dark asset proliferation across the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.
- `Gini_entropy_builder.py`: Script for building Gini entropy measures.
- `Gini_entropy_random_builder.py`: Script for building randomized Gini entropy measures.
- `assortativity_builder.py`: Script for building assortativity measures.
- `assortativity_random_builder.py`: Script for building randomized assortativity measures.
- `community_builder.py`: Script for building community structures.
- `gs_diffusion_daily_weekly_final.py`: Main script for grayscale diffusion on a daily and weekly basis.
- `gs_ground_truth.py`: Script for establishing ground truth data.
- `gs_plotting_weekly_final.py`: Script for plotting weekly grayscale diffusion results.
- `jsonResults_v3`: Directory containing JSON results.
- `nb_graph_scripts copy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with graph scripts (copy).
- `nb_graph_scripts.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with graph scripts.
- `nb_scratchbook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for scratch work.
- `nb_uniform_black_sanity-check.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for uniform black sanity check.
- `nb_zarr_test.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Zarr testing.
- `network_builder.py`: Script for building network structures.
- `obsolete`: Directory containing obsolete scripts and files.
- `readme.md`: This README file.
- `shell_scripts`: Directory containing shell scripts.
- `util.py`: Utility functions.
- `walletexplorer_DNM`: Directory containing wallet explorer darknet market data.

## Setup and Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paint-black-master.git
   cd paint-black-master
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the various scripts, you can use the following commands. Make sure you have activated your virtual environment.

For example, to run the grayscale diffusion script:
```bash
python gs_diffusion_daily_weekly_final.py
```
